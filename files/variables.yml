# When the above is set to 'openstack' this format (dictionary) is used:
#   image_map: (dict) mapping of peon names to version strings
#       version string: (string) UUID/Name of image to use
#   key_name: Name of key-pair to use for cloud-init
#   public_network: Name/UUID of floating-ip network
#   public_sec_group: CSV Name/UUIDs of security group when peon.private == False
#   private_sec_group: CSV Name/UUIDs of security group when peon.private == True
#   userdata: structure to supply to cloud-init

# Peon value format: (dictionary)
#   name: Required, partial identifier for VM (combined with adept_identifier)
#   defaults: Optional, retrieved values from peon_defaults w/ this key
#   version: Optional, arbitrary version / type string for image mapping
#   groups: Optional, list of ansible-group lists to join.
#           One dynamic group, '{{adept_job}}' will always be added.
#   private: # Use private / security mode when True
#   volume: # Optional, if non-empty, size (GB) of additional storage attach

# These values will be used as defaults in place of any required/missing
# values for each peon below.  The item name must match the value from
# the 'defaults' item in the peon format above.  The special 'defaults'
# value item, applies when no other match is found.
