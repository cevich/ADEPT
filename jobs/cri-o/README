This job "{{ job_name }}" (from adept/jobs/{{ job_name }}),
exercises CRI-O using it's upstream test playbook.
It's fairly heavy-weight resource usage means concurrent
executions should be monitored and job cleanup strictly
enforced.

The "main.yml" playbook from the CRI-O repository executes
during the 'run' ADEPT context, followed by 'results.yml'.
However, the final exit code will be that from 'main.yml'.

All output/results collected under {{ workspace }}/artifacts/HOSTNAME
after the 'run' context is complete.
