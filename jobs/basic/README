The {{ job_name }} job is intended to exercise
Docker with a small subset of tests.  It uses
"all-defaults" peons and a simple Docker Autotest
setup.

Docker Autotest results for each peon are located
under subdirectories by inventory-name.  Also
in these subdirectories, are 'adept_result.txt' files
containing details about the last job role that
was successfully applied.

Further details may be obtained by examining the
exekutir or kommandir's ansible logs, located in
their respective workspace directories.
