{# This is a jinja2 template rendered into the artifacts directory #}

The {{ job_name }} job is intended to exercise Docker with a small subset
of tests.  It uses an "all-defaults" peon and Docker Autotest configuration.

Docker Autotest results for each peon are located under subdirectories of
this `results` directory (by inventory-name).  Also there are
`adept_result.txt` files containing details about the last role that
was successfully applied.

Further details may be obtained by examining the exekutir or kommandir's
ansible logs, located in their respective workspace directories.
