Hacking
===========

Run the unittests
-------------------

This requires the additional test/development `prerequisites`_
These tests run relatively quickly, and only do a self-sanity check
to verify major operational areas.

    $ unit2

    OK (skipped=1)


Run the CI test job
--------------------

This is a special ADEPT-job which runs entirely on the local machine,
and verifies the operations of most major *exekutir* and *kommandir* plays.
It does not have perfect coverage, for example, no cloud-based resources
used.   It can be run with ``adept_debug`` and/or ``--verbose`` modes
to retain the temporary workspace for examination.

Local Kommandir
----------------

Having a *kommandir* ("slave") node is useful in production because it offloads
much of the grunt-work onto a dedicated system, with dedicated resources.  It also
decouples the job environment/setup from the execution environment.  Using one
only makes sense in production-environments where the 5-minute setup cost can
be spread over tens or hundreds of jobs.

However, for local testing/development purposes, the extra *kommandir* setup time
can be excessive.  If the local system (the *exekutir*) meets all the chosen cloud,
*kommandir*, and job `prerequisites`_, it's possible to use the *exekutir* also as the
*kommandir*.  Note, however, the *kommandir's* ``job.xn`` transition file and playbooks will
still run from a dedicated workspace (created by the Exekutir).

Set the `Exekutir's ``kommandir_groups`` variable <kommandir_groups>`_
to include ``nocloud``.  If required, also enable
`the flag to create network-accessable peons <public_peons>`_.

::

    kommandir_groups: ["nocloud"]
    public_peons: True

.. _repeat_contexts:

For reglar/automated use, avoid repeating any context transition more
than once, against the same workspace or manually running Ansible.
However, for development/debugging purposes, depending on the job-specifics,
most contexts may be re-applied (within reason).  Doing this may require
manual manipulation of the `uuid`_ unless existing VMs are to be re-used.
Otherwise, it's safest to apply the ``cleanup`` context, then start over again
with ``setup`` against a fresh workspace, with a fresh `uuid`_.

OpenStack Cloud
------------------

This is the default for all bundled *peons* as per the peon_cloud_group_ variable
value.  The openstack group variables demand that you either set the ``$OS_*``
environment variables correctly, or dropped a ``clouds.yml`` file in
the relevant workspace_.

#. **Important**, verify that all the default peon images are accessable
   to your tenant by examining the group variable file:
   ``kommandir/inventory/group_vars/openstack/peon_images.yml``.  If any
   are incorrect, fix them before proceeding.  Otherwise, those *peons*
   will most certainly fail to be created.

#. Setup your OpenStack credentials via the standard ``os-client-config``
   file ``clouds.yml``, in the workspace, as show below.  The
   options are specific to your particular OpenStack setup.  See the
   `format and options, documented here <https://docs.OpenStack.org/developer/os-client-config/>`_.

    .. include:: ex_ws_setup.inc.rst

    .. include:: clouds_yml.inc.rst

#. Populate `the *exekutir's* variables <variables_reference>`_.
   In this example, the default (bundled) *peon*
   definitions are used (from ``kommandir/inventory/host_vars/``). The other values
   select the job, name the kommandir VM, enable debugging and setup subscriptions.
   The final value makes sure the *kommandir* VM has access to the same cloud for
   creating the *peons*

    ::

        $ cat << EOF > $WORKSPACE/exekutir_vars.yml
        ---
        job_path: $PWD/jobs/basic
        kommandir_name_prefix: "$USER"
        adept_debug: True
        rhsm:
            username: nobody@example.com
            password: thepassword
        extra_kommandir_setup:
            command: >
                cp "{{ hostvars.exekutir.workspace }}/clouds.yml"
                   "{{ hostvars.exekutir.kommandir_workspace }}/"
        EOF

   *Note:* If you want/need access to the peons as well, be sure to enable the
   `public_peons`_ flag.

#. Apply the ADEPT ``setup`` context.  Once this completes, a copy of all runtime
   source material will have been transferred to the workspace.  This includes
   updating initial ``exekutir_vars.yml`` and inventory files.  `As noted,
   manual changes made to the source <repeat_contexts>`_, will not be reflected
   at runtime unless the workspace is manually updated.

    .. include:: adept_setup.inc.rst

#. Apply the ADEPT ``run`` context and/or inspect the workspace state.

    .. include:: adept_run.inc.rst

#. Whether or not ``setup`` or ``run`` were successful, always apply ``cleanup``
   to release cloud resources.

    .. include:: adept_cleanup.inc.rst


Other Clouds
----------------

A multitude of topologies are possible by changing the values of a few host and group variables.
From the *exekutir's* perspective, the *kommandir* will be created according to whichever
group is set via kommandir_groups_.  For example, "openstack" will cause the group variables
from ``exekutir/inventory/group_vars/openstack.yml`` to be brought in.

From the *kommandir's* perspective, all default *peons* are created by membership dictated
by the peon_cloud_group_.  This value is used to help populate the peon_groups_ variable.
The default value of "openstack" will cause all default *peons* to created according to variables
defined in the group variables files ``kommandir/inventory/group_vars/openstack/*.yml``.
