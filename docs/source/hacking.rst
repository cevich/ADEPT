Hacking
===========

Run the unittests
-------------------

This requires that ``python-unittest2`` is installed and/or
the ``unit2`` command is available.  These tests run relatively
quickly, and do a self-sanity check on all major operational areas.

::

    $ unit2
    ...............................s......................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 54 tests in 9.998s

    OK (skipped=1)


Run the CI test job
--------------------

This is a special ADEPT-job which runs entirely on the local machine,
and verifies the operations of most major Exekutir plays and roles. It's
not perfect, and doesn't test any provisioning or peon-setup aspects.
Optionally, it can be run with ``adept_debug`` and/or ``--verbose`` modes
to retain the temporary workspace for examination.  It requires all the
prerequisites listed for both Kommandir and Exekutir systems.

::

    $ ./test_exekutir_xn.sh
    localhost ######################################
    Parameters:
        optional = '-e some_magic_variable_for_testing='value_for_magic_variable''
        xn = 'exekutir.xn'
        workspace = '/tmp/tmp.wfyfHGypgq.adept.workspace'
        context = 'setup'

    ...cut...

Local Kommandir
----------------

Having a *kommandir* (a.k.a. "Slave") node is useful in production because it offloads
much of the grunt-work onto a dedicated system, with dedicated resources.  It also
decouples the job environment/setup from the execution environment.  Using one
only makes sense in production-environments where the 5-minute setup cost can
be spread over tens or hundreds of jobs.

However, for local testing/development purposes, the extra *kommandir* setup time
can be excessive.  If the local system (the *exekutir*) meets all the chosen cloud,
*kommandir*, and job :ref:`Prerequisites`, it's possible to use the *exekutir* also as the
*kommandir*.  Note however, the *kommandir's* ``job.xn`` transition file and playbooks will
still run from a dedicated workspace (created by the Exekutir).

Set the Exekutir's ``kommandir_groups`` (list) variable to include ``nocloud``
and enable the flag to create peons with cloud-external IP addresses.
e.g. In ``exekutir_vars.yml``:

::

    kommandir_groups: ["nocloud"]
    public_peons: True

Avoid repeating any context transition more than once, against the same
workspace.  The same advice applies to recycling ``uuid`` values.  Both
can be done if needed, but require some careful manipulations of files
in the workspace which isn't straight-forward.  It's safer to apply
the ``cleanup`` context, then start over again with ``setup`` against
a fresh workspace.


Openstack Cloud
------------------

This is the default, if no ``kommandir_groups`` are specified.  I implies
that you've either set the ``$OS_*`` environment variables correctly,
or dropped a ``clouds.yml`` file in the workspace (see below).


#. Create a local workspace directory, and setup your openstack credentials
   via the standard ``os-client-config`` file ``clouds.yml`` as show below.  Most of the
   options are specific to the particular openstack setup.  The file
   `format and options are documented here`_.

    .. include:: ex_ws_setup.inc

    .. include:: clouds_yml.inc

#. Populate the *exekutir's* variables.  In this example, the default (bundled) *peon*
   definitions are used (from ``kommandir/inventory/host_vars/``). The other values
   select the job, name the kommandir VM, enable debugging and setup subscriptions.
   The final value makes sure the *kommandir* VM has access to the same cloud for
   creating the *peons*

    .. include:: clouds_yml.inc

#. Apply the ADEPT ``setup`` context.  Once this completes, a copy of all runtime
   source material will have been transferred to the workspace.  This includes
   updating initial ``exekutir_vars.yml`` and inventory files.  As noted elsewhere,
   manual changes made to the source, will not be reflected at runtime unless
   they are manually copied into the correct workspace location.

    .. include:: adept_setup.inc

#. Apply the ADEPT ``run`` context and/or inspect the workspace state.

    .. include:: adept_run.inc

#. Whether or not ``setup`` or ``run`` were successful, always apply ``cleanup``
   to release cloud resources.
